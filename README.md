## Introduction

> ***Note:*** _This can be a pair programming activity or done independently._

In this lab, we will be continuing our work on the Grocery List: when the user clicks on one of the grocery items, your app will navigate to a new activity that will display extra details about the item. The details you need to display are already stored in the columns for `description`, `price`, and `type`. See the screenshots below for an example.

## Exercise

#### Requirements

- Allow the user to click on a grocery item to go to a detail screen
- Display all four details from the database
- Gather the details for the selected item from the database (not passed through the intent)

**Bonus:**
- Add additional columns to the database and display those on the details screen
- Add an additional activity to allow the user to add more groceries to the list

#### Starter code

The [starter code](starter-code) contains the solution code to the Databases w/ RecyclerViews lab with a few small updates (the SQLiteOpenHelper was turned into a singleton, and the ShoppingItem class has a field for ID). If your code from that lab was working properly, you may continue using that codebase instead, if you prefer.

#### Deliverable

Here are screenshots of what the master and detail views should look like:
